===================================
replicate1=analysis that Ash has completed
replicate2=new data



Notes
Untreated vs smoke-treated cells
Summary: create a model in lab for chronical smoking in lung cell lining
        tumor from this lining have genetic and epigenetic changes but do not understand well
initial analysis - genome wide
small bar - list of genes that are methylated; how many of those genes that are methylated are
        k4 marked at the time point
        basically
in culture, over 3months, across the genome, the genes take an increase in k27
from TSS, +/- 2500 bp
        that wide for k27
        k4 - wouldnt have that big of a window
             nucleosome starts around 2kbp from TSS
what changes here is bivalency; how did it change?
        genes with both marks is increasing




meeting
=================
10 days ezh2 increase

1st iteration

CHECK:
1. is expression going down at 3M timepoint?
2. Ash/genes- globally, methylated genes - very low expression to begin with
- didnt look at basal level ***
  
  
flaw in p16 argument
all genes start out low exp, and then 
p16 expressed in stem, and when cellls go into sensescnece


cells are shipped, printed on plastic

cells have no polycomb so it correlates with k4 going down
polycomb with starting dna meth, antagonistic 
polycomb not maintained well with highly methylation

3. genes that get methylated in C but not CSC
- we are taking genes methylated in cigarette smoke
- are there a set of genes that get methylated in C, but not CSC - do they follow a similar pattern

- denovo methylation may not be accurate because genes get a bit of methylation with age



- genes specifically methylated in cig smoke
- why is cig smoke changing the dynamic of gene methylation

ezh2 methylation
ezh2 protein catalyzes polycomb


dnmt1 - take inverse(color) --> black to white, instead of white to black
chip-chip - cpgi, no dnmt1
- hypermethylated gene: before damage, they sit up stream
- dnmt1 over TSS

expand the 

scripts - border around cpgi, take cpgi, sort genes, normalize size of island, and

pick 7 or 8 genes, and use them as examples
- use delta beta close to .4, and on high end (.8)

***regenerate plots for highly.expressed
UPDATE: can be found in ~/shwang26/Michelle/BED_files/Coverage_TSS_200bp_bin/normalizedBED_200bp_bin/outputdir/highly.expressed/
- highly.expresed at 10M
- change the color


k4 - C to CSC, drastic increase

run kates viral immune cells through***
- gene panel already checked against expression data

EMT phenotype - increase in environment expression
- tgfbeta expression??

pbs documentary - env, cig smoke




RERUN WITH NEW NORMALIZED DATA
==============================

                    create ann bar?     stable.10M     stable.10M.new      highly-expressed    combined avg plots?      
norm 10bp
norm 200bp
unnorm 10bp
unnorm 200bp
